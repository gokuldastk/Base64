# Base64 Encoder and Decoder (Swift)

This is a simple Swift project that demonstrates how to manually encode and decode strings using Base64 encoding. The project is designed for beginners who want to understand how Base64 encoding works without relying on built-in libraries.

üìÅ Project Structure

base64/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Base64.swift   # Contains the Base64 class with encode and decode functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.swift     # Main program to interact with the user
